/**
 * Producer-side pipe that emits values INTO the conduit system.
 * <p>
 * < p >< b >Role in Architecture:</b >
 * ProducerPipe represents the producer endpoint in the Producer-Consumer pattern.
 * It emits values INTO the conduit system, which then routes them to registered
 * ConsumerPipe instances via subscriber notifications.
 * <p>
 * < p >< b >Creation:</b >
 * Created by Channels when application code calls {@code conduit.get(name)} or
 * {@code channel.pipe()}. Each ProducerPipe is bound to a specific Channel's Subject,
 * preserving WHO emitted for subscriber routing.
 * <p>
 * < p >< b >Circuit Queue Architecture:</b >
 * Instead of putting Captures directly on a BlockingQueue, ProducerPipes post Scripts to the
 * Circuit's Queue. Each Script creates a Capture and invokes the subscriber notification callback.
 * This ensures all Conduits share the Circuit's single-threaded execution model
 * ("Virtual CPU Core" design principle).
 * <p>
 * < p >< b >Transformation Support:</b >
 * When created without a Flow, emissions pass through directly.
 * When created with a Flow, emissions are transformed (filtered, mapped, reduced, etc.)
 * before being posted as Scripts. Transformations execute on the emitting thread,
 * minimizing work in the Circuit's single-threaded queue processor.
 * <p>
 * < p >< b >Subject Propagation:</b > Each ProducerPipe knows its Channel's Subject, which is paired
 * with the emission value in a Capture within the Script. This preserves the context
 * of WHO emitted for delivery to ConsumerPipes via Subscribers.
 * <p>
 * < p >< b >Subscriber Notification:</b > Holds a subscriber notification callback provided by the Conduit
 * (via Channel at construction time). This callback routes emissions to the Conduit's registered
 * subscribers, who then dispatch to their ConsumerPipes.
 *
 * @param < E > the emission type (e.g., MonitorSignal, ServiceSignal)
 * @see ConsumerPipe
