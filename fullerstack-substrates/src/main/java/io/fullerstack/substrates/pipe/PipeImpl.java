/**
 * Implementation of Substrates.Pipe interface with Lombok for getters.
 *
 * <p>A Pipe provides typed emission with optional transformation support via Segment.
 *
 * <p><b>Circuit Queue Architecture:</b>
 * Instead of putting Captures directly on a BlockingQueue, Pipes post Scripts to the
 * Circuit's Queue. Each Script creates a Capture and invokes the emission handler callback.
 * This ensures all Conduits share the Circuit's single-threaded execution model
 * ("Virtual CPU Core" design principle).
 *
 * <p>When created without a Segment, emissions pass through directly.
 * When created with a Segment, emissions are transformed (filtered, mapped, reduced, etc.)
 * before being posted as Scripts.
 *
 * <p><b>Subject Propagation:</b> Each Pipe knows its Channel's Subject, which is paired
 * with the emission value in a Capture within the Script. This preserves the context
 * of WHO emitted for delivery to Subscribers.
 *
 * <p><b>Sibling Coordination:</b> Holds an emission handler callback provided by Source
 * (via Channel). Source and Channel are siblings owned by Conduit. This is NOT callback
 * passing through layers - it's dependency injection at construction time. The callback
 * routes emissions to Source's private distribution logic.
 *
 * <p>Transformations are executed by the emitting thread before posting the Script,
 * minimizing work in the Circuit's single-threaded queue processor.
 *
 * @param <E> the emission type (e.g., MonitorSignal, ServiceSignal)
